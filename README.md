Note* build file present in this repository is configured for the development PC. It is very important that the end-user be familiar with running ROMS, outside of this scripting package.  A good place to start with a different, basic setup for the unfamiliar is: https://www.myroms.org/wiki/ROMS_UNSW2008.
